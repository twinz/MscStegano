This software is a MSc Project for my 4th Year in the University of Kent. The purpose is to ?nd a way to detect messages hidden in images using PixelKnot software. PixelKnot hides text into an image thanks to steganography. To do so, I implemented two articles. The ?rst one, "Steganalysis of JPEG images: Breaking the F5 Algorithm" of Jessica Fridrich, Miroslav Goljan and Dorin Hogea. And the second one, "JPEG steganography detection with Benford’s Law" of Panagiotis Andriotis, George Oikonomou and Theo Tryfonas. So I implemented their work to check if they could be applied to PixelKnot. In order to validate and evaluate their research, I developed steganographic tools which are able to analyse image ?les. The Benford's attack work well. But my implementation of the Fridrich attack didn't work
